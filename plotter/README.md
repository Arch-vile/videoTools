## Make a map

Use the excellent https://pullautuskartta.fi/ to create an image of the area. The gist is that you cannot download high precision images from the site directly so we need to manually combine screenshots. Here is how:

1. Load the whole route (many gpx) files to the site so that you can see the area you need to cover.
1. Place a distance calculation diagonally over the route so that the bouncing rectanble covers the whole route.

1. Toggle of the area rectangle

1. Zoom in the tool to what ever resolution you want to be the largest (e.g so that route of a one day fits on single screen)
1. Pan the map until you see the top left corner of the distance marker at your zoom level
1. Take a note of the cross map marker that is closest but outside the bouncing rectangle
