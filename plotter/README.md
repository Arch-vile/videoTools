## Make a map

Use the excellent https://pullautuskartta.fi/ to create an image of the area. The gist is that you cannot download high precision images from the site directly so we need to manually combine screenshots. Here is how:

1. Load the whole route (many gpx) files to the site so that you can see the area you need to cover.
1. Draw a rectangle around the route using the measurement tool

1. Toggle off the area rectangle

1. Zoom in the tool to what ever resolution you want (e.g so that route of a one day fits on single screen)
2. Click on the loaded gpx route to remove it
3. Starting from the top left corner start taking screenshots (at the wanted resolution). Use the cross markers on the map for reference. Take the screenshot so that you leave some extra near the crosses.
